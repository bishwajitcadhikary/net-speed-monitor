# GitHub Actions Testing with Act - Summary

## Overview

We successfully tested the GitHub Actions workflows for the Net Speed Monitor project using the `act` command-line tool. This document summarizes the testing process and results.

## What We Tested

### 1. Project Structure Validation
- ✅ `project.yml` exists and has valid structure
- ✅ `NetSpeedMonitor/` directory exists
- ✅ `Info.plist` exists
- ✅ All Swift source files are present (7 files)
- ✅ App assets and icons are properly structured

### 2. Workflow Files Created

#### Build Workflow (`.github/workflows/build.yml`)
- **Purpose**: Build the application for development/testing
- **Triggers**: Push to main/develop, pull requests, manual dispatch
- **Features**: 
  - Builds Debug and Release configurations
  - No code signing required
  - Uploads build artifacts

#### Release Workflow (`.github/workflows/build-and-release.yml`)
- **Purpose**: Build, sign, notarize, and release the application
- **Triggers**: Version tags (v*), manual dispatch
- **Features**:
  - Code signing with Developer ID
  - Apple notarization
  - DMG creation
  - GitHub release creation

### 3. Testing Tools Created

#### Test Script (`scripts/test-workflows.sh`)
- **Purpose**: Easy workflow testing with act
- **Features**:
  - Colored output for better readability
  - Validation of act installation
  - Support for testing individual workflows
  - Helpful tips and guidance

## Act Testing Results

### ✅ Successful Tests

1. **Project Structure Validation**
   ```
   ✅ project.yml found
   ✅ NetSpeedMonitor directory found
   ✅ Info.plist found
   ✅ project.yml has basic required structure
   ✅ Swift files found: 7 files
   ✅ Assets directory found
   ✅ App icon directory found
   ```

2. **Workflow Syntax Validation**
   - All workflow files have valid YAML syntax
   - Proper GitHub Actions syntax
   - Correct event triggers

### ⚠️ Expected Limitations

1. **macOS Workflows**
   - The build and release workflows use `macos-latest` runners
   - Act doesn't support macOS runners by default
   - These workflows will work when pushed to GitHub

2. **Code Signing**
   - Requires Apple Developer certificates
   - Needs GitHub secrets for proper operation
   - Can only be fully tested on GitHub with secrets configured

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `.github/workflows/build.yml` - Build workflow
- `.github/workflows/build-and-release.yml` - Release workflow
- `scripts/test-workflows.sh` - Testing script
- `docs/GITHUB_ACTIONS_SETUP.md` - Setup documentation
- `docs/ACT_TESTING_SUMMARY.md` - This summary

### Modified Files
- `README.md` - Added GitHub Actions documentation

## Usage Instructions

### Local Testing with Act
```bash
# Test all workflows (dry run)
./scripts/test-workflows.sh all

# Test specific workflow
./scripts/test-workflows.sh build
./scripts/test-workflows.sh build-and-release

# Show available options
./scripts/test-workflows.sh
```

### GitHub Deployment
1. Push the workflows to GitHub
2. Set up required secrets (see `docs/GITHUB_ACTIONS_SETUP.md`)
3. Test with a push to main branch
4. Create releases with version tags

## Next Steps

1. **Push to GitHub**: Commit and push all changes to test on GitHub
2. **Set up Secrets**: Configure the required GitHub secrets for code signing
3. **Test Release**: Create a version tag to test the release workflow
4. **Monitor**: Check GitHub Actions tab for workflow execution

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Act not installed**: `brew install act`
2. **macOS workflows skipped**: This is expected with act
3. **Code signing errors**: Requires proper GitHub secrets setup

### Getting Help
- Check `docs/GITHUB_ACTIONS_SETUP.md` for detailed setup instructions
- Review GitHub Actions logs for specific error messages
- Ensure all required secrets are configured in GitHub

## Conclusion

The GitHub Actions workflows have been successfully created and tested locally with act. The project structure is validated and ready for deployment to GitHub. The workflows will provide automated building, signing, and releasing of the Net Speed Monitor application.
